We have all been there. You’re at a new place, or point in your life, and you need friends to hang out with, laugh, and have a good time.
One of the biggest struggles for recent graduates, is finding people with common interests that they can hang out with and have fun. Sure, there’s your work buddies, but we all know it’s not the same. There’s a tension, because you guys are competing, for a raise, position, etc. Maybe he/she is your boss, the point is, you just can’t be yourself, and it’s not always a genuine friendship. It’s hard to find friends now, because in school you were surrounded by like-minded individuals, most of whom understood they were at a new point in their life, and were open to meeting new people. So how do you find people with common interests today? You may meet some through friends of friends, etc. But why wait?

LaunchScreen:
When a user taps the AppIcon, they are greeted, for a moment, with the following launch screen.

LoginScreen:
If it’s the first time a user is using YNot, they are directed to the following LoginScreen, prompting them to log in using their Facebook. Using Facebook makes people liable for any content they may put in the App. People are less likely to put pornography, etc in the app knowing their accounts are linked with Facebook. Facebook also gives us a nice, secure login system to greatly simplify development. The Facebook button is themed like Facebook to give the user a familiar feel. Open-Sans is the typography of choice for our company, along with Raleway; two modern, yet classy typefaces to accent our theme and distinguish the app from every other iOS app. Dapper-Apps’ theme places emphasis on photography, hence the background photo of two friends talking. The photograph has been photoshopped to give it a Dapper-Apps style, and focus attention towards the center of the photograph, the conversation. Terms of agreement are expressed on the bottom.

HomeScreen
The user is then directed to the home screen of the application. The home screen touts the title of the app at the top, as well as Settings, and Schedule icons on either side of a search bar, as well as a table showing all nearby pue's (pick-up-events) in the near area, including an empty cell at the top giving the user the option of creating an event. As a user scrolls down the table, the title disappears behind the status bar (similar to the status bar in safari), and tapping the title scrolls the list back to the top (default iOS behavior.) Each table cell contains a background image chosen by the user who created the pue, as well as information on what time and date it takes place, how far it is and it’s location, as well as a description, custom category, and ellipsis menu granting users the option of reporting a pue for inappropriate content. If a user wishes to add an event to their schedule, they simply swipe the tile to the right (as is done with many other elements in iOS - namely email, messages, tinder, etc.) if a user wishes to remove an element from the list, they would swipe the pue to the left.

SettingsScreen
The settings screen allows a user to change app settings or go back to the home screen. By tapping on the first image, a user can change their profile (screen not present) - how other users see them, including linking their accounts with Instagram or other services. Below, a user can find discovery settings, as well as notification settings (subject to change). The theme and general idea are portrayed here. Strong emphasis on our theme gradient along with the background, elements of social photography, as well as our typography.

ScheduleScreen
The schedule screen shows users a timeline of schedules they have swiped into their schedule. At the top, a Date/time picker shows grouped events taking place at such intervals, allowing users to jump to specific dates or times (for those super active users). At the very bottom, old events are displayed - greyed out (transparented out?).

PueScreen
The pick up event screen comes up when a user taps on a pick up event either from the home screen or their schedule screen. If a user tapped on the event from their schedule screen, they get a functional chat tab, otherwise it is grayed out. The details page shows more details of the pue to the user, including an apple maps control showing where the event takes place. Another tab displays people attending the event and when tapped, displays each person’s profile.
